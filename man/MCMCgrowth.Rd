The \code{MCMCgrowth} class contains the results of a growth prediction
consider parameter variability based on a model
fitted using an MCMC algorithm.

It is a subclass of list with items:
\itemize{
\item sample: Parameter sample used for the calculations.
\item simulations: Individual growth curves calculated based on the parameter
sample.
\item quantiles: Tibble with the limits of the credible intervals
(5\%, 10\%, 50\%, 90\% and 95\%) for each time point.
\item model: Instance of \code{FitDynamicGrowthMCMC} used for predictions.
\item env_conditions: A tibble with the environmental conditions of the simulation.
}
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{print.MCMCgrowth}: print of the model

\item \code{plot.MCMCgrowth}: plot of predicted growth (prediction band).
