\arguments{
\item{x}{an instance of FitMultipleGrowthMCMC.}

\item{...}{ignored}

\item{y}{ignored}

\item{add_factor}{whether to plot also one environmental factor.
If \code{NULL} (default), no environmental factor is plotted. If set
to one character string that matches one entry of x$env_conditions,
that condition is plotted in the secondary axis}

\item{ylims}{A two dimensional vector with the limits of the primary y-axis.}

\item{label_x}{label of the x-axis}

\item{label_y1}{Label of the primary y-axis.}

\item{label_y2}{Label of the secondary y-axis.}

\item{line_col}{Aesthetic parameter to change the colour of the line geom in the plot, see: \code{\link{geom_line}}}

\item{line_size}{Aesthetic parameter to change the thickness of the line geom in the plot, see: \code{\link{geom_line}}}

\item{line_type}{Aesthetic parameter to change the type of the line geom in the plot, takes numbers (1-6) or strings ("solid") see: \code{\link{geom_line}}}

\item{line_col2}{Same as lin_col, but for the environmental factor.}

\item{line_size2}{Same as line_size, but for the environmental factor.}

\item{line_type2}{Same as lin_type, but for the environmental factor.}

\item{point_size}{Size of the data points}

\item{point_shape}{shape of the data points}

\item{subplot_labels}{labels of the subplots according to \code{plot_grid}.}

\item{object}{Instance of \code{FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}.}

\item{times}{A numeric vector with the time points for the simulations. \code{NULL}
by default (using the same time points as those for the simulation).}

\item{newdata}{a tibble describing the environmental conditions (as \code{env_conditions})
in \code{\link{fit_multiple_growth}}. 
If \code{NULL} (default), uses the same conditions as those for fitting.}
}
\description{
The \code{FitMultipleGrowthMCMC} class contains a model fitted to a set of dynamic
experiments using an MCMC algorithm. Its constructor is 
\code{\link{fit_multiple_growth_MCMC}}.

It is a subclass of list with the items:
     \itemize{
         \item fit_results: the object returned by \code{modFit}.
         \item best_prediction: a list with the models predictions for each condition.
         \item data: a list with the data used for the fit.
         \item starting: starting values for model fitting
         \item known: parameter values set as known.
         \item sec_models: a named vector with the secondary model
         for each environmental factor.
         }
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{print.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: print of the model

\item \code{plot.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: comparison between the model fitted and the
data.

\item \code{summary.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: statistical summary of the fit.

\item \code{residuals.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: model residuals. They are returned as a tibble
with 4 columns: time (storage time), logN (observed count),
exp (name of the experiment) and res (residual).

\item \code{coef.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: vector of fitted model parameters.

\item \code{vcov.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: variance-covariance matrix of the model,
estimated as the variance of the samples from the Markov chain.

\item \code{deviance.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: deviance of the model, calculated as the sum of
squared residuals of the prediction with the lowest standard error.

\item \code{fitted.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: fitted values of the model. They are returned
as a tibble with 3 columns: time (storage time), exp (experiment 
identifier) and fitted (fitted value).

\item \code{predict.FitMultipleGrowthMCMC}: model predictions. They are returned as a tibble
with 3 columns: time (storage time), logN (observed count),
and exp (name of the experiment).
