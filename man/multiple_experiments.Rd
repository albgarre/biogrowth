\title{A set of growth experiments under dynamic conditions}
\format{
A nested list with two elements. Each element
corresponds to one experiment and is described by a list
with two data frames:
\describe{
\item{data}{a tibble describing the microbial counts. It has 2 columns:
time (elapsed time) and logN (logarithm of the microbial count)}.
\item{conditions}{a tibble describing the environmental conditions. It has
3 columns: time (elapsed time), temperature (storage temperature) and pH (pH of the media).}
}
}
\usage{
multiple_experiments
}
\description{
An example dataset illustrating the requirements of
\code{\link[=fit_multiple_growth]{fit_multiple_growth()}} and
\code{\link[=fit_multiple_growth_MCMC]{fit_multiple_growth_MCMC()}}.
